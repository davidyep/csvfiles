Asthma and pulmonary conditions are more prevalent in communities along the BQE.  Air pollution from vehicles contributes not only to these worse public health outcomes but also to climate change.  A redesign of he BQE should focus on increasing green spaces, reconnecting neighborhoods that are disconnected due to the highway, and ensuring that the volume of vehicles using the BQE does not increase.  

Increasing roadway capacity would only lead to increased roadway use and higher traffic volumes, worsening the health outcomes of communities living along the BQE and making New York prioritize vehicles over public spaces, at a time when many large cities are doing the opposite.  The redesign should focus on creating greener spaces, connected communities, and healthier air.","Air Pollution, Green space",Negative

I often cross Meeker at Union Ave and the cars coming off the exit onto Meeker drive fast and recklessly.

Make it across that, then traverse the dark and damp underside of the BQE only to have to wait for a 2nd walk signal on the other side and do it all again.

These two policies will shield the infrastructure from excessive load and shield the neighborhoods from excessive noise and vibration.  Perhaps also: (C) Reduce the road to two lanes in each direction (i.e., leverage the power of ""induced demand"").

2. Improve the on-ramps and off-ramps. They are dangerously short and force tight turns. Honestly not too sure how you can find the room to do this in these heavily over-built sections of downtown Brooklyn but it is a priority nonetheless.

Instead, the city is making it harder for businesses and people to drive and to get to their destinations. Limiting lanes or collecting fees don’t help to improve the situation but will force the businesses or families to move out of NYC because of the none user friendly policies. NYC should expand the BQE and closely monitoring the traffic safety. Since more people are driving electric vehicles, it’s more quiet and greener than ever.

Additionally, the inclusion of parking meters (without community input) under the  BQE has only made conditions more dangerous - while all those parking spots go unused, people park in the daylight zones/pedestrian refuges/crub extensions, on bike lanes, or completely on the crosswalk constantly. I place 311 complaints constantly, and nothing is ever done about it, especially when the police can be seen doing the same at every possible opportunity. More people are also parking in front of bus stops than I've ever seen before, and during the pandemic drivers have only gotten infinitely more reckless and dangerous. The metered parking has also made it even more difficult for my coworkers, who often have to commute from areas that don't have a good connection to our school in sunset park via public transit, to find parking. My partner works in Staten Island and is forced to drive (there used to be ferrys in industry city and BAT that connected to Staten Island, and turning the BQE into a train that connected to Staten Island would fix this issue). My partner has had an impossible time finding parking since the meters were added. 

Additionally, the ongoing construction on the BQE has been going on at all hours for weeks - even until late at night or very early in the morning. It has disrupted my home and my classroom, it is clear that there is no concern for the people who actually live here but those who will drive through our neighborhood.

Congestion is made worse when the already busy roads are further constricted by policy and public transit is not seen as a safe option. Furthermore, many people in this city simply enjoy driving, whether for leisure or convenience. Hundreds of thousands of people in this area of Brooklyn alone own cars. Make the alternatives more attractive instead of penalizing those who drive. As for the BQE/Gowanus itself, large scale improvements must be made in the area between Bay Ridge and the Brooklyn Bridge. This must include fortification of the section under the promenade to ease the 24/7 bottleneck there and repaving of the road surface itself. Some areas of the road are so damaged it is dangerous. Honestly, the options in this survey show that there is a disconnect between what is should be happening and what thought of as beneficial. NYC has plenty of Green space already.

Consider utilizing the HOV lane on the weekends and extend past the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel.

Work with NYC ferry to extend the Rockaway route to go past pier 11 wall st to points further north without transfer to provide an alternative to driving along the BQE.

Create a ferry that allows cars to park on it that zips past the BQE with a stop in Staten Island, then a stop in Brooklyn (ideally Brooklyn Army Terminal) that will transport cars and people to the point where the congestion ends and where drivers can drive off and continue their journey north/south without ever having to go on the bad part of the expressway. This will alleviate the last mile problem that discourages ferry usage.

Develop a monorail or elevated train that is super express with less than 5 stops total. For example, first stop in bay ridge-Bensonhurst-kings plaza then next stop Manhattan wall st and midtown. Do this throughout the city. All the stops on the subway create a poor rider utility- especially for further afield neighborhoods so people just choose to drive for time and ease.

It would also be great if the WB Wythe and Kent Aves exit was redone as NYCDOT proposed to CB1 in 2019, because the amount of congestion there, even at off-peak times, is safe for nobody. It would also be nice if there were new bike and better pedestrian facilities on the 86th and 92nd Street overpasses in Bay Ridge. My school is east of the trench and whenever I take the subway there I need to cross it, and the walk isn't the most pleasant, to say the least. The primary way I've experienced the BQE these last eight years has been as a passenger on a school bus, so if the Central section is returned to 3+3 lanes, an exclusive HOV/Bus lane would probably speed up a lot of students' journeys every day.

Plain and simple New Yorkers want to be able to get from point A to Point B seamlessly, and not be inflicted with as much pain on them so they should be forced to give up their cars, all in the name of climate change. 

While climate change is definitely an very important issue, it is unamerican (and kind of Stalinistic) to make people suffer immensely to reach a goal - in America and certainly in New York the goal does give you permission to use all means at your disposal, there are plenty of other ways to address the issue of climate change without aggravating millions of New Yorkers, such as EV Cars incentives, planting more trees, incentivize mass transit and much more.   

The traffic congestion on the BQE is intolerable, please do everything to mitigate traffic congestion. It will make driving safer, more clean, and add valuable time to thousands of New Yorkers who will use this time to engage in more business practice, more production, building a better and more prosperous New York, and of course - spending more time with their loved ones. 

Reducing congestion will also undoubtedly reduce accidents and road rage incidents - as people coming out of congestion are more likely to be frustrated and drive aggressively.

I really hope that instead of reducing lanes we should be adding lanes so cars can drive cleaner, safer, and happier. Perhaps add a fourth express lane for EV cars and HOV (minimum 4 people).

Living beside it has a number of challenges including quality of sleep since there are so many disturbances associated with the elevated highway. Being jolted awake on weekly (sometimes daily) basis from accidents on the highway, the loud grind of breaks from cargo trucks, the unnecessary pops of illegal straight pipe motorists racing. The highway produces a lot of trash on the sidewalks below too, everything within it vicinity has a layer of dust, grim and debris. Access to basic community services can be a challenge because the highway cuts us off from our community. The structure is rusting and crumbling. There is constantly concrete falling from the span even though there is a constant barrage of construction crews who seem to only be able to do patch work - they alone can not fix this.

The light changes too quickly for even a young fit person to cross, and it's gross. I was extremely unhappy when the parking was taken away under the bqe for metered parking, particularly because no matter what you do no sane person will ever want to ride their bike under the bqe overpass.

It's dangerous - people hang out there and drink and do drugs. but most importantly it's dangerous to cross the street or ride a bike there - some intersections are slightly better than others, but cars regularly make sharp fast turns down side streets, making it dangerous to cross even when you have the signal. They also try to run lights, sometimes they need to because to turn left under the BQE means they have to run a yellow. Also, visibility for pedestrians is terrible when driving on Meeker. As a driver, I can't see what lane I should be in and the structure of the bridge makes it hard to see pedestrians because the support columns hide them when turning.

Very few intersections even have accessible curbs, appropriately timed lights, well-lit intersections - let along traffic calming measures that would protect pedestrian life and safety. 
2) the underpass is littered with derelict and abandoned vehicles. This is space that could instead serve as a safe bicycle path or other green space to offset the polluting overpass above, but instead is used to warehouse unused cars.

Besides that, the whole structure is a neglected, dangerous mess.

Cars and big trucks run the lights, do not yield and push pedestrians out of the way making access to and from brooklyn bridge park dangerous. The south side dumps fast moving cars and heavy trucks onto Atlantic. They speed down Atlantic to beat the lights. Plus all the congestion from hicks street to the on ramp, Atlantic to the on ramp and Columbia st to the on ramp is unreal in the mornings. There aren’t even traffic agents stationed there. If it were Manhattan DOT or NYPD or whomever oversees them, would have an army of traffic agents directing flow.  The intersection light system and yield is horrible. Who designed that? The one right arrow on Atlantic backs traffic up on hicks, Clinton and Atlantic for blocks — starting at Hamilton Ave sometimes. This flow should be studied in city planning classes on how not to merge traffic and pedestrian and bikes safely. I would encourage some active observation on how that madness plays out everyday.  Plus the residential streets are packed with cars in traffic and  drivers in a rush to bypass the BQE to go home to bay ridge and Staten Island or to work in Manhattan.  It’s simply not fair to residents and children whom live in brooklyn heights, cobble hill  Carroll gardens and along Columbia street. I’ve noticed an uptick on pedestrians hit by cars/trucks on Atlantic through hoyt st because of the bay overflow. I’m altered on my citizen app all the time. How is this acceptable? DOT needs to take on the project from the larger issues that all play into the BQE problems. So far, I’ve heard nothing about the things I’m writing about now.

118241089901,Feb 10 2023 07:21 AM,"The BQE causes our building to vibrate. The noise from trucks using engine brakes is a regular feature of life. And the ability to cross to Red Hook, Brooklyn Bridge Park or cycle south to Industry City and Bay Ridge is severely constrained by the lack of crossings and the state of the roads. Congestion from the BQE often spills over to Hamilton Avenue and associated roads, and to Atlantic Avenue. Clearly the major improvements would come from congestion pricing to encourage drivers not to travel into Manhattan. Ending universal free parking would also encourage suburban drivers to use cheaper public transit. Enforcing parking restrictions, and cracking down on abuses by law enforcement such as those documented on Streetsblog.com, would also encourage public transit use. And financial penalties for truck noise are also needed - and need to be enforced fully. The looming rebuilding of the section through Brooklyn Heights should not be an opportunity to expand capacity. I personally support the idea of burying the BQE there and restoring fully walkable links to and from the waterfront and Red Hook. On a more granular level, safe cycling around the BQE corridor is poor. It’s time to take a lane of traffic away on each side of Hamilton and Third Avenues for fully reserved, barrier-protected cycling lanes. The same should be done on major roads feeding into the BQE corridor - Atlantic Avenue, Court Street, Third and Fourth Avenues, 39th, 60th Street and Shore Road. Finally, long-term thought to charging higher-polluting vehicles much more modeled on London’s successful low-emission zone should be carried out with the proceeds hypothecated to investing in the subway and other MTA rail systems.
